The code will be updated on here.

Dear DOT Recruiter Team,

I would like to sincerely apologize for the delay in submitting my test results. Unfortunately, I accidentally clicked "Start the test" earlier than planned, which has impacted my ability to complete the test within the allotted time.

I kindly request an extension until tomorrow at 2:00 PM to finish the test to the best of my ability.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Best regards,
Dandy Firmansyah
